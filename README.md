  This image symbolizes hope for me. The image shows a man that is seemingly content and excited to share his knowledede with someone else. In order for him to share knowledge he must first have knowledge,
  and also be able to articulate this knowledge. This means that he not only understands what he is doing, but he can confidently convey the concepts and techniques 
  that he knows. The reason this image symbolizes hope for me is because everything that I've explained about what this image says to me is everything that I hope to have
  accomplished by the end of these next few months. I foresee me accomplishing my goals, and I can imaging this image becoming my reality.
